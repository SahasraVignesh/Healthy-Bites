<h4>Kashayam is a traditional Ayurvedic herbal decoction commonly used in India. It is believed to have various health benefits, and different combinations of herbs are used for different purposes, including managing fever. However, it's important to note that while kashayam may be a part of traditional practices, its effectiveness in treating specific conditions may vary, and it should not replace professional medical advice and treatment.
Here's a basic recipe for a fever-reducing kashayam. Remember to consult with a healthcare professional before trying any herbal remedies, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions or are taking other medications.</h4><br>
